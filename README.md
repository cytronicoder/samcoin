# Samcoin

This is Samcoin, a meme/fake coin designed to be used as a joke during [Lion City Hacks 2022](https://lioncityhacks.com/). It is built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) because it's for the memes not to use React or Next.js.

## How to run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

A local instance of the app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## How to use

This is a very simple app that allows you to create an account, buy and sell Samcoins, and view your transaction history. You can also view the current price of Samcoins. The app is not connected to any real blockchain, so you can't actually send Samcoins to other people (yet).

## Future plans

- Figure out an actual tokenomics system
- Get transfer of Samcoins between users working
- Add a leaderboard and a way to earn Samcoins by doing tasks (?)
- Memes (obviously) and fake ads
